# Quant Interview Prep
Welcome to quant_interview_prep, a collection of resources and problem solutions aimed at preparing for quantitative finance (quant) interviews. This repository is organized into four key areas: Combinatorics, Probability, Statistics, and Trading. Each section covers important concepts and problem-solving techniques, including detailed explanations and coding solutions (whenever applicable) using Python.

Whether you're preparing for your own quant interviews or just looking to strengthen your knowledge in these areas, you'll find a wealth of useful material. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!

## Directory Structure
- [Combinatorics](Combinatorics/README.md)
    - This section covers key combinatorics concepts, such as permutations, combinations, and advanced counting techniques that often appear in quant interviews.
    - Each problem comes with a markdown explanation and Python code to demonstrate the solution.
    - Key concepts and formulas are documented in the README.md file located within this directory.
- [Probability](Probability/README.md)
    - The Probability directory includes problems on probability theory, conditional probability, Bayes' theorem, and probability distributions.
    - Each problem is explained step-by-step in the .ipynb files, with supporting code snippets.
    - The directory's README.md file outlines essential probability concepts and theorems relevant to quant interviews.
- [Statistics](Statistics/README.ipynb)
    - This directory focuses on statistical concepts, including hypothesis testing, regression, and statistical distributions commonly used in quantitative finance.
    - Rather than a traditional README.md file, this directory contains a README.ipynb where key statistical tests and concepts are implemented directly in code. It includes detailed markdown explanations of various statistical methods used in quant interviews.
- [Trading](Trading/README.md)
    - The Trading directory addresses concepts related to algorithmic trading, market dynamics, and financial models.
    - Problems in this section range from simple models to more complex trading strategies, complete with explanations and code.
    - The README.md file contains summaries of core trading concepts, including key formulas and ideas around financial markets.


## Who is This For?
This repository was initially created for my own preparation as I embark on the quant recruiting process, but it contains valuable materials that anyone preparing for quant interviews—or simply looking to reinforce their understanding of these topics—can benefit from. Whether you're a student, job applicant, or a professional, feel free to use these resources as part of your study routine.

## Future Plans
- Add more problems in each section.
- Expand the Trading section with real-world algorithmic trading challenges.
- Explore stochastic processes and machine learning applications for quant interviews.
