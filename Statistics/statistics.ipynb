    "# Quilt Shop\n",
    "A quilt shop sells three different colored quilts: blue, red, and green. Of the first 1000 quilts sold, 400 were green. Calculate the appropriate test statistic to determine if customers have a preference for green quilts. Assume random sampling, variance homogeneity, and that preference is approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "Because we are comparing the observed proportion of green quilts sold to the expected proportion of green quilts sold under a normal distribution ($1/3$), we can use the one-sample z-test for proportions.\n",
    "- $H_0$: $p = 1/3$\n",
    "- $H_a$: $p \\geq 1/3$\n",
    "$$ z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} = \\frac{0.4 - 1/3}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1/3(2/3)}{1000}}} \\approx 4.47$$\n",
    "where $\\hat{p}$ is the observed proportion of green quilts sold, $p$ is the expected proportion of green quilts sold, and $n$ is the number of quilts sold. Solving for this, we get $z \\approx 4.47$. The critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96, and $4.47 > 1.96$, so we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that customers have a preference for green quilts."
