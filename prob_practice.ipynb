    "# Ascending Dice Rolls\n",

    "- Let $A$ be the event that we roll three different numbers\n",
    "- Let $B$ be the event that three rolls are in strictly increasing order\n",
    "- Let $P(A)$ be the probability of event $A$\n",
    "- Let $P(B)$ be the probability of event $B$\n",
    "- Let $P(B|A)$ be the probability that we roll three numbers in strictly increasing order given that we roll three different numbers\n",
    "- Let $P(A \\cap B)$ be the probability that we roll three different numbers in strictly increasing order\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we can use conditional probability. Recall that the probability of an event $B$ given that event $A$ has already occurred is given by the formula:\n",
    "$$P(B|A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)}$$\n",

    "$P(B)$ is the probability of any three distinct numbers being in ascending order. There is only one ascending order between 3 distinct numbers, and there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange the three numbers. Therefore, $P(B) = \\frac{1}{3!} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n",
